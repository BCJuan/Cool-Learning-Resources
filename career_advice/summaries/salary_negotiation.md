# Negotiation matters

- Negotiation is key, suck less at it.
    - $5k increase during negotiation is easy, while worrying it is not.
- The reality is that rich, successful people negotiate.
- Virtually any amount of money available to you personally is mouse droppings to your prospective employer. They will not feel offended if you ask for it.

## How to search for a job?

- (Optional but recommended) Establish a reputation in your field as someone who delivers measurable results vis-a-vis improving revenue or reducing costs.
- Have a hiring manager talk with you, specifically, about an opening that they want you, specifically, to fill.
- Talk informally (and then possibly formally) and come to the conclusion that this would be a great thing if both sides could come to a mutually fulfilling offer.
- Let them take a stab at what that mutually fulfilling offer would look like.
- Suggest ways that they could improve it such that the path is cleared for you doing that voodoo that you do so well to improve their revenue and/or reduce their costs.
- (Optional) Give the guy hiring you a resume to send to HR, for their records.  Nobody will read it

## Initial rules
- Only negotiate salary after you have agreement in principle from someone with hiring authority that, if a mutually acceptable compensation can be agreed upon, you will be hired.

- "If I even attempt to negotiate this, the deal will fall through" is worrying for nothing. The absolute worst outcome of negotiating an offer in good faith is that you will get exactly the contents of that offer. Let me say that again for emphasis: negotiating never makes (worthwhile) offers worse.

- You do not start negotiating until you already have a "Yes-If." (Yes-If we agree on terms.) Do not start negotiating from "No-But." (No-But we might hire you anyway if you're really, really effing cheap.)

- This means that any discussion of compensation prior to hearing "Yes-If" is premature. If you're still at the job interview and you're talking price, you are doing something wrong. The ideal resolution to the job interview is for both sides to be optimistic about the arrangement, and then you close with a warm handshake and:
"I look forward to receiving your offer by, oh, would tomorrow be enough time for you to run the numbers?"

## Never give a number first

- "I'm more concerned at the moment with talking to you about discovering whether we're a mutual fit. If we're a great fit, then I can be flexible on the numbers with you and you can be flexible on the numbers with me. If we're not a great fit, then the numbers are ultimately irrelevant, because your company only hires A players and I only work at roles I would be an A player at."


## Repeat to people what they say
- You know what people find persuasive? Their own words. People love their own words. When you talk to them, you should use their own words. Seriously, watch the eyes light up.

- Did the solicitation for the job say, "We are seeking someone with strong skills at scaling traffic in a fast-moving environment"? Pick out the key words.
Scaling traffic. Fast-moving environment.
Reinterpret or rephrase the (true) bits of your own story such that it fits the narrative framework which they have conveniently told you that they are going to respond to.

- Notice how often I say "We" and variations on "mutual win."
Those work pretty well. The only thing better than "We" is "You" (and variants).
    - You should talk about their problems, concerns, and wishes.
    - You should guard against your own natural tendency to bring up irrelevant things like your own problems.

## Take notes during interviews

- Focus on specific words they use and concerns they have so that you can come back to them later in the conversation. Numbers are another good thing.

- You never need a job. Being needy means that the party who is not needy has automatic leverage over you; your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) to the negotiation is very poor.

## Research

- You should, before any job interview, have intimate knowledge of the target company.  Prospective peers within the company are one obvious way to get it.  So are ex-employees, folks who’ve had dealings with them professionally, etc.  Key things you want to learn:
    - What do they value?
    - Who do they value within the company?(Roles?  Titles?  Groups?)
    - What does the career path look like for successful people within the company?
    - Roughly speaking, how generous are they with regard to axes that you care about?
    - Do they have any compensation levers which are anomalously easy to operate?  (For example, if you asked around, you might hear a few people say that a particular firm pushes back modestly on out-of-band increases in salary but they’ll give in-the-money option grants like candy.)

## Many preferences, not only salary

- Don’t overly focus on your salary number.  It is important (of course), but there are many parts of your compensation package, and many more things that you value. 
    - Hop around the offer (suggesting other perks: vacation days, work hours, project assignments, travel opportunities, professional development opportunities, ...). That will defuse tactics like "I have to run this through $EXTERNAL_AUTHORITY.
-  You should strongly consider having an $EXTERNAL_AUTHORITY of your own (like family). Then, you can use it as: “That sounds reasonable, but I’ll have to run it by the family”
- **Micro-tip**: “Interesting” is a wonderful word: it is positive and non-commital at the same time.  If they tell you a number, tell them it is an “interesting” number, not a “wonderful” number.
